			'description' => "Manchester City Football Club wanted a simple way to present planned activity, growth and digital strategy to board members and digital trade shows. This needed to span across several seasons. Working with the Creative Director Andy McClane, we developed a future roadmap based on a solar system diagram. This was an effective way to show progress throughout the years.<br /><br />The original idea was to push the capabilities of CSS and HTML5, creating a dynamic 'live' map that could be updated through a content management system. This would, of course, work across all mobile devices.<br />Unfortunately, in the end a much more simplified version was created using pre-built Flash presentation software. In terms of longevity, functionality, and mobile compatibility I wasn't so sure this was the correct route, but as it turns out everyone was happy and it served its purpose.<br /><br />Sensitive and confidential information has been omitted in these screenshots.<br /><br />–<br />Art Direction & Design<br />Created at <a href='http://www.aqueduct.co.uk' target='_blank'>Aqueduct</a><br />Creative Director: Andy McClane",

The content emphasis has shifted slightly over the years and it’s less about the advertising and marketing industries and more about life in general these days. A kind of Grumpy Old Man’s Diary.<br /><br />I produced a simple identity, initially as a book cover for his published Droop articles. In 2012, I designed an online home for them to live, and created a set of illustrations.
