        Project images are full width by default. Selecting one of the options below will float the images according to the size shown, but remember to pair one ratio with another. For example: half-size images should be ordered next to each other and likewise for third and two-thirds images.


        Layout ratios do not affect thumbnails or homepage feature images.
